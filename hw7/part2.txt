(a) - Backward Chaining begins with the goal, so criminal(evil) leads us to american(evil), which is true because Dr. Evil is american. The next step gives us weapon(Y) which leads us to missile(m1), which evaluates Y for weapon(Y) to "m1 is a missile". The next step brings us to sells(evil, m1, Z) evaluates to sells(evil, X, nono), so X = m1 and Z = nono. missile(m1) exists and owns(nono, m1) also evaluates to missile(m1). Finally for the last condition hostile(Z), Z is evaluated to "nono" then evaluates to enemy(nono, america), which is true because "The country Nono is an enemy of America"

(b) - Forward Chaining starts with the facts, so we know that m1 is a missile (missile(m1)), Nono is an enemy of America (enemy(nono, america)) and that Dr. Evil is an American (american(evil)). We know that Missiles are weapons, so weapon(m1) is true, as well as Nono is hostile torwards America because Nono is an enemy of America (hostile(nono) :- enemy(nono, america)). Then, we know that the missile m1 belongs to Nono because owns(nono, M) :- missile(M) and that all of Nono's missiles were sold by Dr. Evil. Therefore, if Dr. Evil is American and the missile m1 is a weapon, and Dr. Evil sold a weapon to a hostile country, then Dr. Evil must be a criminal.
