S -> aBb | cAd
A -> eA | f
B -> gBh | i

FIRST SET: First small letter, including epsilon.
FOLLOWS SET: First small letter AFTER said big letter, excluding epsilon. If it's a big letter, follow rabbit hole.


Eg:
FIRST(S) -> {a, c}
FIRST(A) -> {e, f}
FIRST(B) -> {g, i}

FOLLOWS(S) -> {$}
FOLLOWS(A) -> {d}
FOLLOWS(B) -> {b, h}
